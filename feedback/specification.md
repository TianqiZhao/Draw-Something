### The product backlog (10/10)

10:  Product backlog is generally complete and adequate. The game need a lot of interaction with the server, so make sure your server side work is split properly. And also, a spreadsheet-like format is easier to show the backlog and would be more readable.

### Data models (9/10)

9:  Models are generally complete but there are several problems. In your model design, you did not provide any information about how to store and share your canvas drawing information between two users. Also, the Message model is not clear because it served as many different messages, may be you can use seperate models for different message type.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)

10: Wireframes are generally complete and adequate. Your wireframes looks good. 

### Additional Information

In your specification, you only provide general function description. However, `Draw Something` need a lot of websocket technologies. So I strongly suggest that you should think about the whole process when you start to coding. Also, make sure you first finish the main drawing and guessing function first. Do not spend too much time on features such as ranking and search room.
